Introduction
============

Project Overview
----------------
RailSim is a sophisticated simulation tool developed upon decades of research (:cite:t:`koutsopoulos2007simulation` and :cite:t:`zhou2022urban`) and development to address the operational challenges faced by heavy rail systems in major metropolitan areas, particularly during peak periods when demand is highest. This tool provide microscopic simulation model for heavy rail systems, enabling detailed analysis of train behaviors, signaling systems (fixed-block and moving block), and interactions between trains and passengers. By employing RailSim, reseachers can evaluate various operating strategies such as skip-stop, station consolidation, and dwell control to mitigate capacity bottlenecks. 

The simulation framework is built using Python in a unix environment, ensuring robust performance and flexibility. The model's accuracy and reliability can be further enhanced through a calibration process using data from Operational Control Systems :cite:p:`wang2011calibration`. Numerous visualization tools allow users to analyze simulation outputs.

Numerous case studies (see :cite:t:`zhou2020evaluation` and :cite:t:`zhou2022schedule`) demonstrate how MIT RailSim has helped agencies address congestion, improve service reliability, and support long-term planning decisions.
