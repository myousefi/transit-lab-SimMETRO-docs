Getting Started
===============

Quick Start
-----------
1. Prepare the input files:
   - Ensure you have the following files in the `inputs` directory:
     - infra.json: Infrastructure data
     - slow_zones.json: Slow zone definitions
     - demand/odx_demand.csv: Passenger demand data
     - schedules/empirical_schedule.json: Train schedule data

2. Configure the simulation:
   - Open the `load-balance/config.yaml` file
   - Adjust the following parameters as needed:
     - simulation.number_of_replications
     - simulation.start_time_of_day
     - simulation.end_time_of_day
     - demand_level
     - station
     - short_turning
     - logger.should_log_trajectories
     - logger.log_interval

3. Run the simulation:
    python -m mit_rail_sim.simulation_runner.runner

4. Check the output:
   - Look for the generated log files in the specified log folder (default: `log_folder_path`)
   - You'll find CSV and JSON files with various simulation data

Understanding the Inputs and Config
-----------------------------------
1. Infrastructure (infra.json):
   - Defines blocks, stations, and path information for Northbound and Southbound directions

2. Slow Zones (slow_zones.json):
   - Specifies areas with reduced speed limits

3. Demand Data (odx_imputed_demand_2024-04-07_2024-05-30.csv):
   - Contains passenger arrival rates at stations

4. Schedule Data (empirical_schedule_83.json):
   - Defines train dispatch times and routes

5. Configuration (config.yaml):
   - simulation: Set replication count, start and end times
   - demand_level: Adjust overall passenger demand. Used as a multiplier to uniformly scale demand.
   - station: Specify holding station (e.g., "O-Hare" or "Clark/Lake")
   - short_turning: Set short turning location ("UIC" or "Western")
   - logger: Configure logging options

By adjusting these inputs and configurations, you can simulate various scenarios and analyze the rail system's performance under different conditions.
